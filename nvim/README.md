# nvim

My neovin config.

## Lua

I wanted to write this is lua and builtin lsp, and I did. However, I'm a noob when it comes to lua and following tutorials etc was really hard. I ended up deciding that it's better just to go back to vimscript and coc, since it's more mature.

It's still on my todo list to refactor everything to use lua and builtin lsp instead of vimscript and coc.

## What's in here
