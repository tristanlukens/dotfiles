# nvim

My neovim config.

## Lua and LSP

I wanted to write this is lua and builtin lsp, and I did. However, I'm a noob when it comes to lua and following tutorials etc was really hard. I ended up deciding that it's better just to go back to vimscript. I initially had coc again, but figured I didn't need it really. It was too slow and I was using vscode anyway.

I now have only some plugins but no language server setup whatsoever.

It's still on my todo list to refactor everything to use lua and builtin lsp instead of vimscript and coc.

## Todo

In no particular order.

- [ ] move to lua and lsp (see Lua above)
- [ ] git integration
- [ ] adding more fzf function keybindings
