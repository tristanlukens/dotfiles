# nvim

My neovim config.

## Lua and LSP

I wanted to write this is lua and builtin lsp, and I did. However, I'm a noob when it comes to lua and following tutorials etc was really hard. I ended up deciding that it's better just to go back to vimscript and coc, since it's more mature.

It's still on my todo list to refactor everything to use lua and builtin lsp instead of vimscript and coc.

## TODO

In no particular order.

- [ ] move to lua and lsp (see Lua above)
- [ ] set things up for go development
- [ ] set things up for ruby development
- [ ] get a theme switcher
- [ ] seperate out [coc.vim](./plugins/coc.vim)
- [ ] write a section in this readme explaining how to set up eslint and prettier
