# nvim

This is my nvim setup as my day-to-day text editor. It has IDE features, but no completion and language servers. That's for nvim-ide to take care of.

The plans for the future are to set up nvim as an ide, and always use it. I couldn't get completion to work though, so it's not a good alternative for vscode, which is what I'm using right now.
