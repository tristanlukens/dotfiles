# zinit script (only this script, not the plugin manager :)) by Tristan Lukens
# tristanlukens.github.io

# the first part of this script is the part which is added to $HOME/.zshrc when the install
# script is run. I use ZDOTDIR to move my .zshrc to .config/zsh, which breaks zinit's system.
# I have opened an issue on github to fix this, but this is a solution

## --sourcing--
# I do not use .zshrc for anything; my actual zshrc (symlink) is in $HOME/.config/zsh
# I can safely remove it as long as other programs do not use it
