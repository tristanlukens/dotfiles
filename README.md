# dotfiles
**my dotfiles**



## notes
To make EVERYTING work exactly how I want it, you need the SF fonts (by apple, so not for linux). I will probably fix
this by moving to another font entirely.

I tried to set up vim for go but this is not finished yet, so things aren't working


## items
- vim/neovim config
- zshrc
- gitconfig
- alacritty



## todo
- rewrite this readme
- set up nvim for go and c(++)
- when cd is used in terminal, execute la (an alias itself for ls -la) too


### long-term todos
- move to amethyst or create some kind of wm myself. another option is making shortcuts (skhd?) or scripts (applescript? lua?) to manage windows
- move to LSP for autocomplete instead of coc
- write a shell script to set up macOS with the `defaults` tool and `dockutil` and execute it when `git pull` is run in $HOME/dotfiles
- write seperate shell scripts for setting up different things on a computer; macOS settings, dotfiles, npm, go, etc. this way, it will be modular and cross-platform.
- MOVE TO LINUX ALREADY
