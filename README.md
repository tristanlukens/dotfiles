# dotfiles
**my dotfiles**



## notes
To make EVERYTING work exactly how I want it, you need the SF fonts (by apple, so not for linux). I will probably fix
this by moving to another font entirely.



## items
- vim/neovim config
- zshrc
- gitconfig
- vscode settings.json
- alacritty
- rectangle
- macOS preferences
  - **dock**



## todo
- make README more verbose
- set up nvim for go and c(++)
- change the way to track the Rectangle, Amethyst and macOS preferences: make shell script which edits plists and executes when `git pull` is done AND when the directory is dotfiles. is a little bit broken
    though, because you can do `git pull [directory]` but I'm not sure on that one
- move to another font (which is for linux too)



### long-term todos
- move to amethyst or create some kind of wm myself. another option is making shortcuts (skhd?) or scripts (applescript? lua?) to manage windows
