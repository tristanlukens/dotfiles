# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## What's in here

- iterm
- zsh
- nvim
- git
- yabai
- skhd
- karabiner
- various bash scripts

There's individual READMEs everything but git. Everything has its own folder.

I sync my Visual Studio Code settings with the the built-in feature, but I really only use nvim anymore ðŸ˜Ž

## General Todos

There's individual todos sections in the seperate READMEs.

- [ ] create a script for moving themes to ayu. for everything. I like it better than gruvbox
- [ ] make dotfiles location modular, probably using `${0:A:h}`, but I can't get symlinks to be resolved at the time of writing
- [ ] move to pnpm from npm; this would require configuring pnpm to be in .local/share instead of ~/Library in macOS
- [ ] configure python ## Post-setup steps
- [ ] autmate installation of these dotfiles

# tristan for the love of god please move to linux
