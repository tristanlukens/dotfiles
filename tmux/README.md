# tmux

My tmux config.

## Status bar

I wanted to use [this](https://github.com/LawAbidingCactus/tmux-gruvbox-truecolor) plugin for the colours, but it made the terminal cursor do funny things after vim had closed. The thing looks amazing however, so it's definately on my todo-list to solve that bug.

## Todo

- [ ] check if tmux still generates log files. if it does, fix it by making them go to another directory
- [ ] move plugins to a seperate file. I couldn't get it to work
