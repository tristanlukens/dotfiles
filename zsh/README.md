# zsh

My zsh config.


It only consits of the zshrc, but since I wanted to write this readme, I put it in a folder.

## Configuration

My configuration is very simple: it's some aliases and fixes, with a prompt and vim mode loaded through a plugin with zinit (which is therefore installed). I'm not doing crazy shit yet, because I don't know how.

## Todo

- [ ] edit the colour of the "in" text of the prompt
- [ ] add git support to the prompt
- [ ] get a better way of calling compinit, I don't think it's perfect
- [ ] do some research on zinit: will installation and sourcing code ever break (updates?)?
- [ ] move to zpm from zinit, I think it's a little better
- [ ] properly fix the cursor style, setting keytimeout=1 is kind of a hack
- [ ] make autostart script better
